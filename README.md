# Rest-API-with-flask
For creating this type of project you need a virtual envoirnment in this case you share your code file to anyone.

creating virtual envoirnment in windows - (python -m venv <envoirnment name>).
and then open file requirement.txt to look which dependencies it needed and install them.
i used swagger ui for API testing.
for user authentication i used jwt which create unique token.
you also need a docker to create docker image.
if u have any proble with docker then run this command <wsl --update> in your terminal.

For creating Docker container image from terminal <docker build -t (image name)>.
